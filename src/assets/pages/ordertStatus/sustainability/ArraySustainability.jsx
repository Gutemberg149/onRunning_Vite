We aim to use 100% certified organic cotton as well as 100% mulesing free wool.<br/>We've also launched our Cyclonâ„¢ program, the first of its kind with the goal of circularity, materials used are reused. In addition, in North America, we have Onward, an easy way to get more out of slightly used shoes. ",
