      "What is the Cyclon Program and how is it connected to the On account?",
    answer:
      "You don’t own Cyclon™ running products. Our groundbreaking circularity program is subscription-only and managed with your On account. This is how it works: Step 1: Subscribe, create an account and add your personal details (shipping address, card details, etc.). Step 2: We ship your pair of Cloudneo and start charging your card the Cyclon™ subscription fee. After this, the cycle continues. Run in your pair of Cloudneo. After 6 months, check to see if they're worn out. Then, request to recycle and return the old ones to us, and we'll use the recycled material to make new shoes. Easy. Visit our Cyclon™ page to find out more.",
